Readme File for breast cancer project
#=====================================
Breast Cancer Sequenced Sample Information:
bam files: 1361 bams, bam file location is shared in Slack data channel (The new version). There are 1365 listed bams, M_210197.merged.mkdup.bam, M_231022.merged.mkdup.bam, M_231050.merged.mkdup.bam, M_240397.merged.mkdup.bam are the old bams not deleted by Ashley.

The samples are sequenced by four different batches (BRC (8 old CGC samples?), CGC, Yale, Regeneron), the batches information is shown in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/data/phenotype/Sample_batches.txt

#=====================================
Breast Cancer main data directory (Ashley): /home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer
folders:
AJ_CONTROLS/	All related information for Jewish controls. Alaska Jewish (AJ).
Dominican_PCA/	All related information for Dominican controls.
MountSinaiData/	All related information for MountSinai WES data.
Regeneron/	All related information for Breast Cancer families data.
tablesandlists/	Old tables and lists by Ashley.

In /home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Regeneron/Filtering_Oct2015, you will find tables of the filtered variants based on the Freeze One data release. The VCF contains ALL of the samples that we have.

There is a file that contains a list of samples to exclude from the analysis as they are outliers based on het/hom rate, sex mismatches etc.
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Regeneron/FreezeOneVariantCalling/Outliers_to_be_excluded.list
There are 12 samples in all, 4 of which are samples that were sequenced at CGC or Yale (with IDs "Sample_M_XXXX" or "M_XXXX"). There is no need to exclude any sample due to gender discrepancy, these were all fixed in the resequencing.

Also, note that there are 21 samples that were sequenced at both CGC/Yale and Regeneron. These are listed in Repeated_Samples.list. The CGC/Yale data can be identified by "cgc" appended to the sample ID in the vcf. The variant table for these samples into a subdirectory of the variant tables directory:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Regeneron/Filtering_Oct2015/cgc_duplicates/

#=====================================
Phenotype annotations:
The phenotype annotated table is listed in: /home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/data/phenotype/WES BCFR phenotypic data.csv, which also shared in DropBox BreastCancer folder as WES BCFR phenotypic data.xlsx. There are 1338 samples, it annotated as 741 Jewishes (J), 552 Hispanic (H), 1 Jewish and Hispanic, 44 unknown.
Note that there are two samples with two different sample IDs. 
The samples 222357 and 222966 are from the same individual:
Family ID: 200415
Individual ID: 2007915  
The samples 220897 and 220904 are from the same individual:
Family ID: 200352
Individual ID: 2007050
Note that Hispanics in this table are more likely to be Dominicans. In this readme file, we just treat them as the same ethnicity.

#=====================================
Pedigree Files:
Directory: /home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/pedigree
Breast cancer WES data contains 154 singletons and 334 families.
All the "available" pedigree information read from .svg files are listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/pedigree/ALL_pedigree.csv
There are three batches got from Regeneron in several times:
FamilyPedigree/	The first bulk .svg files.
LargeFamily/	15 large families with >= 7 members are sequenced. There is still one pedigree information is missing
MissingFamilies/	The rest of families pedigree, 43 families are missing. We got 32 families. Finally, there are 11 of them are missing until now.
svg files are named as FamilyID.svg.
Useful R code for reading .svg file to pedigree is in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/breast_cancer_panel/pedigree.R
This is an example to read all .svg files under one directory into one pedigree table.

#=====================================
PCA analysis for Jewsihes (Ashley): 
Directory: /home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Regeneron/PCA
A complete list of all the breast cancer samples that appear to be AJ based on PCA is shown in:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Regeneron/tablesandlists/All_AJ_samples.list (Ashley version 716 AJs)
I relabeled 220673 (which came from a Hispanic family and the original label is Hispanic) into Hispanic, then I got 715 Jewishes in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/data/phenotype/AJ715_samples.list
After PCA analysis, we got 715 AJs, 550 Dominicans (2 of 552 original Dominicans are re-labeled into Jewishes). 550 Dominican samples are listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/data/HispanicCases550.txt

#=====================================
Jewish Controls by combined different WES batch samples:
Directory: /home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/AJ_CONTROLS/
All the WES data used in PCA analysis to get Jewish controls are listed in DropBox folder:
Dropbox (CGC)/BreastCancerExomeStudy/Genelist_Qiang/AJ_Samples_Table.xlsx
And also:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/AJ_CONTROLS/FinalLists/AJ_Samples_Table.xlsx
The details for each sub-batches are listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/AJ_CONTROLS/FinalLists/cohort_lists
Column E in AJ_Samples_Table.xlsx, labelled "Group", contains either 0 or 1. The samples labelled 1 form a cohort of unrelated samples. Ashley selected these to exclude samples that were 1st or 2nd degree related, e.g. in the case of trios Ashley have kept the parents (1) and excluded the probands (0). 0's are 1st or 2nd degree related to one or more of the samples marked 1, and may also be related to one another.

The batches details for PCA analysis is listed as follows:
Batches	BreastCancer	CHD	Obesity	PCGC	RGN(3)	RGN(4)	RoR	SSC
Samples	716		 7	1	316	195	71	35	84		 
Capture kits for different batches:
Breast Cancer - Regeneron's NimbleGen VCRome kit
PCGC - NimbleGen SeqCap v2
CDH - Agilent V2 (CGC) or V4 (NYGC)
Obesity - Agilent V4
RGN(3) - Regeneron's NimbleGen VCRome kit
RGN(4) - Regeneron's NimbleGen VCRome kit
RoR - Agilent V4
SSC - NimbleGen SeqCap v2
To elimate the batch effects of different capture kits, we don't consider Agilent capture kits further.
Finally, we got 557 Jewish control data with Sample IDs listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/data/AJs_557.txt
The bams files for these samples are listed in (several bams may be moved into other folders by other users):
RGN(3):
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/mnt/BigData/WENDY/RGN_rare_disease/bams
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/REGENERON/NewFreezeThreeBams
RGN(4):
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/REGENERON/DNA_Nexus_scripts
down from DNA Nexus by Ashley.
SSC:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/Simons/BAM/Wigler
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/mnt/ngs_backup/Controls/SimonsExomes
PCGC: updated in Slack data channel shared file.

To reduce the batch effect of NimbleGen VCRome kit for breast cancer, RGN(3), RGN(4) and NimbleGen SeqCap v2 for SSSC and PCGC, we get the intersect of target regions of these two capture kits. To get intersect of target intervals, we use bedtools, example scripts is in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/depthOfcoverage/code/getInterBed.sh
The capture kit target intervals bed files are listed in: #!!!!!!
/home/local/ARCS/ads2202/resources/CaptureKitBeds/ #!!! deleted by other users
All avaiable capture kits are in:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/resources/CaptureKitBeds

Depth of coverage information:
Directory: /home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/depthOfcoverage
Scripts: /home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/depthOfcoverage/code
Note that when calling depth of coverage (DOC) for breast cancer samples, there are some samples with "Error Read group" information. The following is the explaination from Ashley:
"Just FYI, it is that for many of the files the readgroups ID in the bam file does not match the readgroup in the sequence data. The reason for this was the plate swap that occured at Regeneron. They figured out what had happened and basically switched the data in the files so that the correct sequences are in the right file. However, they did not change the read group IDs in the sequence data. So, in these files - the header information is correct and shows the correct Sample ID, however, the RG field needs to be fixed to match."
By now, we only fixed bad read group for 265 index cases of 715 breast cancer jewishes. The useful scripts are in:/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/depthOfcoverage/code/xFixRGErrors_Piped.sh

#=====================================
Dominican controls related analysis:
Directory: /home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Dominican_PCA
There are 584 samples to do PCA analysis. The decision result is listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/yshen/data/WENDY/BreastCancer/Dominican_PCA/PCA/PCA_decisions.tsv
Note that based on PCA result, there are 341 Dominicans for these control data, but they are incompletely independent. By now, we are trying to find maximum number of unrelated samples and other methods to modeling the sample structure.

Variant filtering for each sample based on VCFs:
Ashely's script:  
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/code/ExmFilt.CustomGenotype_with_Table.py (Original file in Ashley's folder had been deleted.)
The main filters are listed as follows (it outputs in each log file):
Genotype Filters:
         Homozygous Reference Samples: None
         Heterozygous Samples: None
         Homozygous Alternate Samples: None
         Not-Reference Samples: SSC08506
         Not-Alternate Samples: None
         Unfiltered Samples: None
Individual Sample Filters:
         Minimum Depth of Coverage: 3
         Minimum Genotyping Quality(GQ): 30
         Minimum Heterozygous allele count: 3
         Minimum Homozygous allele fraction: 0.7
Variant Filters:
         MQ0/DP maximum: 0.05
         1000 genomes alternate allele frequency maximum: 0.01
         GO ESP alternate allele frequency maximum: 0.01
         ExAC alternate allele frequency maximum: 0.01
         Within VCF allele frequency maximum: 0.05
         Predicted Pathogenecity Filters: at least SIFT=D or PP2=D/P or CADD >= 15; all InDels and Nonsense
Example to use this script is:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/code/HIcontrol_filter.sh (Read the .py file to see the file name rule)

Variant filtering for each family based on dominant or recessive models:
Ashely's script:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/code/ExmFilt.CustomGenotype_with_Table.py
Large families selected:
Prioritized 43 families given by Regeneron (/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/families/Prioritized43families.txt),
15 large families with >=7 members sequenced (/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/families/LargeFamilyPhenotype.txt), 
families with >=2 breast cancer cases sequenced (/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/variants/families/FamiliesL2Cases.txt). 
There are 78 of them which contain the pedigree information.
First, we generate inherited models for each family mannually or based on R script:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/breast_cancer_panel/InheritedModels.R
Then, use Ashley's script to call variants for each family.


#=====================================
Breast Cancer main data folder (Qiang): /home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer
The details for sub-folders in the main folder is listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/breast_cancer_panel/Readme.R 
Main codes for the burden test analysis are listed in:
/home/local/ARCS/qh2159/breast_cancer/Panel/breast_cancer_panel 
Without special instruction, all the R code below are in this folder.

#=====================================
Variant filtering:
script: misc.R::variant_filtering function
Rules for variant filters:
	-ExAc frequency < 0.01 (0.001)
	-Population frequency < 0.05 (Only for Jewish)
	-Missense variants: Meta-SVM or Polyphen2 predicted as "D"
	-VCF FILTER: bad SNPs
	-VCF Segmental Duplication score < 0.95
	-Missense hotspots based on Hongjian model
Now, we applied the first five rules except the last one. All of them are optional rules.

For variant list of each family, we used relaxed rules in InheritedModels.R::filtered_LargeFam

#=====================================
Burden test:
A case-control study is a type of observational study in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. The basic idea for burden test based on case-control data is aimed to find that those mutations occurred in cases at a higher rate than expected (observed in controls). For burden test, we can split into three different levels. Level 1: gene set. Level 2: single gene. Level 3: single variant. For each single variant burden test, we compare the number of carriers in cases and the number of carriers in controls, which is measured as folds and fisher test p-values. For each single gene, we treat all variants in one gene as an entirety, and compare the number of carriers of one gene in cases and the number of carriers of one gene in controls, and also measured by folds and p-values. For gene set level, we only combined all genes in one set as one single gene and do the same thing. Note for all burden tests, we firstly split all variants into different types, such as, loss-of-function, damaging missense, indels, synonymous and splicing sites.

Script: misc.R::burden_test function
For gene set test, we used biominal test.
For single gene and single variant tests, we used fisher test.
